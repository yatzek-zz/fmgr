Counting all rows in a database (there is a 10k row limit in the current plan)

Connect to the db:

    heroku pg:psql HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_NAVY_URL

and run this statement:

    SELECT
      nspname AS schemaname,relname,reltuples
    FROM pg_class C
    LEFT JOIN pg_namespace N ON (N.oid = C.relnamespace)
    WHERE
      nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema') AND
      relkind='r'
    ORDER BY reltuples DESC;
